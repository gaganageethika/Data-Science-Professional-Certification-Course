## **Installation Guide üíª**

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gaganageethika/Data-Science-Professional-Certification-Course.git
   cd Data-Science-Professional-Certification-Course
   ```

---

### 2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

#### **a. Create a Virtual Environment**  
For **Windows**:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

For **Mac/Linux**:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### **b. Verify Virtual Environment Activation**  
Run the following command to check if the virtual environment is active:

For **Windows**:
```bash
where python
```

For **Mac/Linux**:
```bash
which python
```

The path should point to the virtual environment folder (e.g., `venv/bin/python`).
